Radii8
======

An online and desktop design, develop and debug tool for creating graphic designs, websites, prototypes and applications. The online version connects to Wordpress and Wordpress MU for storage and retrieval. Using the plugins on the site you can use your live design in your theme.

It uses the Flex SDK as underlying framework (for both the IDE and when publishing an application). It generates MXML, HTML and Android XML. It may in the future publish to other languages.
