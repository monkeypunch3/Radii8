Radii8
======

An online and desktop design, develop and debug tool for creating graphic designs, websites, prototypes and applications. It plugs in to Wordpress for storage and retrieval. It could be adapted to create themes easily. 

It uses the Flex SDK as underlying framework (for both the IDE and when publishing an application).
It may in the future publish to other technologies such.

   - click New Project to see an empty new project (give it a minute to load)
 
 Notes:
 - prototype. 
 - you can create a plugin based on what exists now (see the components in the views package) 

 What needs to be done:
 - conforming this document to https://github.com/infochimps-labs/style_guide/blob/master/style-guide-for-readme-files.md
 - conforming to Git project file and folders structure https://github.com/infochimps-labs/style_guide/blob/master/style-guide-for-repo-organization.md 
 - documentation on getting started
 - needs an application framework
 - needs full plugin API defined. for example for plugins we need things like:
   - getCurrentDocument(), getSelectedItem(), setProperty, getProperty etc
   - currently there are some methods available like 
     - radiate.setProperty(target:Object, property:String, value:*, description:String = null, keepUndefinedValues:Boolean = false);
