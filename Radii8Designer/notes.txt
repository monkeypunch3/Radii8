	Sometimes the generated MXML document is blank. I think it's because if we open
	multiple documents the application never gets completely loaded or rendered in it's tab and the
	user closes the document and reopens it. I think it has to do with the activate event in Flex
	So we need to wait before opening new documents until application complete on the current document.
	We might need to add an event listener in the Document or Project class to make sure each application
	completely loads before opening the next. 
	
	Update 2017 - Added manual call to activate. Haven't had it happen in a while so it might be fixed. 
	
	
	/** MainView.mxml
	 * the library would not compile and had random errors that were not errors. 
		I couldn't figure out what it was. it looks like it's fixed. 
		what i did was change -swf-version=18 from -swf-version=19 and 
		also went into properties then classes and instead of include all i selected
		the files to include. which were not the assets directory but the com.flexcapacitor directory
		let's hope it stays fixed
		 
		 * it did not stay fixed. it complained about PNGEncoderOptions which isn't available below 
		 * swf version 18 or 19. so i tried cleaning, changing swf version up and down 
		 * and many other things and nothing worked still errors. so i switched sdk and that 
		 * removed the errors. 
		 * 
		 * UPDATE: THE PREVIOUS ISSUE WAS POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE playerglobal.swc in the 11.2 or 11.5 was not correct
		 * check date of both they are the same. 
		 * download the playerglobal again. OR its because the playerglobal is not there. add 11.2,11.3,11.5 etc
		
		 * Update 8/28/15 : had to add swf-version=16 and it now works. using sdk 4.6 and air 3.6
		 * 12/18/15 - changed to swf-version=19 or AIR 19 and it works
		 * 
		i still get this warning: 
		The swc '/Users/Documents/ProjectsGithub/flexcapacitor/MainLibrary/bin/FCLibrary.swc' 
		has style defaults and is in the library-path, which means dependencies will be linked in without the styles.  
		This can cause applications, which use the output swc, to have missing skins.  
		The swc should be put in the external-library-path.
		
		i think i fixed the above warning by putting adding the FCLibrary.swc as a swc rather than a project
		 * 
		 * UPDATE: NEED TO SELECT THE SWC AND CHOOSE EXTERNAL PATH
		
		i added all other projects except the radiate projects as swc instead of as projects
		
		i also added reference to PNGEncoderOptions encoder to RadiateReferences.as
		 *
